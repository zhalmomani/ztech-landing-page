                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Z-Tech  cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Z-Tech  customer support team.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Z-Tech  with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Z-Tech  to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
                    Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Z-Tech  will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
